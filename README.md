# PSO2-EachShipEQ
API based Emergency Quest alert on specific ship server.

Still drafting on making this work properly first, either to work with PSO2Proxy or external alert for each call is made.

PSO2-EachShipEQ is an API based EQ alert that will alert player based on the ship they set in the configuration.
This is still in drafting so there will be no actual code running or push as of now.

Stay tuned
