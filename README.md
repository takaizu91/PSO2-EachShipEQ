# PSO2-EachShipEQ
API based Emergency Quest alert on specific ship server.

Still drafting on making this work properly first, either to work with PSO2Proxy or external alert for each call is made.

PSO2-EachShipEQ is an API based EQ alert that will alert player based on the ship they set in the configuration.
This is still in drafting so there will be no actual code running or push as of now.

Stay tuned

** Update **
API are very unstable currently so no push will be made yet

28/3 Update - Had to remake the whole API frame, the previous API failed horribly (lets just say the API itself went crazy)
